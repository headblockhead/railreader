# railreader

Middleman between National Rail's Darwin datafeed, and your project!

Railreader consumes the Darwin Push Port and parses the XML message data into useful values, which it then applies to a database to allow you to query the data however you want!

If you see something that doesn't look right, please speak to me via email (availiable on my GitHub profile) - or create an issue on this repo. Thanks!
