# railreader

Middleman between National Rail and Network Rail's datafeeds, and your project!

This is currently very work-in-progress, and barely functions.
Keep an eye on here though, maybe give this repo a watch or a star? You might come back to find something awesome!

And if you see something that doesn't look right, please speak to me via email (availiable on my GitHub profile) - or create an issue on this repo. Thanks!
